# Discussion items

i have realised that we have a few things that we still need to do as a company. We have a gap in the market and we should take that opportunity now before someone else. We don't have to be perfect in what we do, but one thing is for sure we can be fast follows in our African market and succeed. As a technology company we must be customer zero for all our products and services.

## Market presence

### We need to increase our market presences with immediate effect

1. We need to change the look and feel of our website.
The website that we have is a good start but we need to improve the site. We need a site that will customize user experiences. Obviously we have a lot of technologies that we can you in that respect. But as an open source first company l suggest to have something within the open source community.

2. Knowledge share
One of the most common strategics to get persences online and from interested people is to share knowledge. Given that our company was built with open source we need to have individuals that constantly contribute to open source.

    - We can achieve this by creating short Youtube videos of how our products and services work
    - Talk at conferences around the world
    - Comment on new technology that we would want to adopt
    - Target a specific problem and solve it in a open source way
    - Let's thrive to innovate our SDG goal that we have focused on and share we are doing it

3. Focus on our purpose

    We need to remember that we are a purpose driven company and we should never divert from that. At the moment besides the donations that we are making we don't have any other things that we are doing to our communities.
    - Organise clean up compaigns
    Next door to our office we often see and unpleasent view, let's start from there and try to make that a better environment for our community
    - Wellness events
    As we speak our country has been named as one of the highest suicides rates in the world, forget about Africa, in the world. Just last week there was a lady who killed herself live on instagram. We need to find a way to help these people at least from a technological stand point, obviously we don't have the expertise to solve this problem but we can do our part.
    - Provide free software to NGOs
    This is a tricky one because at times our customer are NGOs, however we have small community NGOs that are doing great things like e.g. "Uncommon" . Ofcourse this can present challenges however once we provide services of the non-profits we will become their go to people for technological solutions.
    - Get our employees involved
    We don't need to work just as Macron, most of our employees joined our organisation because of the fact that we are a purpose drive organisation. We can launch a program where employees can also contribute, we need to be careful not to force our staff into something the is "mandatory". This has to be clear and all our leadership team but opt out to show that this is voluntary.

4. Leveraging Data
We have got a few companies around us that are selling data, we need to see if their data can be filtered to focus on our business. The our sales team need to be hitting the phones and get a SMART strategy on how they can approach this.

5. Training programs
In my vision l think the other thing we need to start doing is to get interns to work with us. Our business is difficult to train someone however we need to do this somehow. HR can come up with a strategy on how we will be able to do this but this will help in our vision.

## Portifolio grow

I'm the number one fan for our sales team that said l think we can still do much much better. I have identified a few areas that can help us to grow our portifolio.

### Products & Services awareness

It is a fact that sometimes our customer don't know that they need a product until they see it in action. This will tie close with what l have mentioned above around sharing knowledge but this will  be more specific. We need to establish connections with and do presentation to the customers directly torwards their specific problem. 

- Sales and the tech team must move to as one. 
- We should train tech people to be sales persons
- Everyone in the company must know what we are selling, like l said before we are the customer zero for all our products and services.

### Introduce new products

We need to partner with more global tech companies and become reseller of their products. We can't not build everything but we can simply resell products that will solve our customer's problems.

#### Supplier by pass

- VPS introduction
    Starting Q3 we need to move close to the food chain. As we speak we are currently almost at the buttom of the food chain. We should start focusing on creating our own VPS that are physically attached to data centers that are close you the regions that we operate in. Personally l don't see us running our own data centers but l can see the need to partner with owners of data centers. 

    I will start to look at opportunities to be able to do that. This will also open doors for sponsorship of our events from bigger corporates.

- Managed services
    As we speak right now we definately have the expertise to be running people's services. We need to introduce managed services in our portifolio as soon as possible. For me this is a loss that we are running at the moment because we can definately manage portifolios for other technology companies that are smaller or even equivalent to our company.

#### Remove some products/services

So we have products that we have been running for a while and these products have been doing good for us in the start however with where we want to go we need to drop some of these products so that we focus on more problem solving solution. One product/service that comes to mind are emails, we manage thousands of email but is it worst at $60 a year, l don't think so. So we should only do that if the product is coupled with something else.

That said we need to be careful on how we exist the market without burning bridges so to speak.
